abstract = {BACKGROUND Currently, bacterial 16S rRNA gene analyses are based on sequencing of individual variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (Kozich, et al Appl Environ Microbiol 79:5112-5120, 2013).This short read approach can introduce biases. Thus, full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is needed to reduced biases. A new alternative for full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing is offered by PacBio single molecule, real-time (SMRT) technology. The aim of our study was to validate PacBio P6 sequencing chemistry using three approaches: 1) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a single bacterial species Staphylococcus aureus to analyze error modes and to optimize the bioinformatics pipeline; 2) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from a pool of 50 different bacterial colonies from human stool samples to compare with full-length bacterial 16S rRNA capillary sequence; and 3) sequencing the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA genes from 11 vaginal microbiome samples and compare with in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region and with bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene regions sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq. RESULTS Our optimized bioinformatics pipeline for PacBio sequence analysis was able to achieve an error rate of 0.007{\%} on the Staphylococcus aureus full-length 16S rRNA gene. Capillary sequencing of the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from the pool of 50 colonies from stool identified 40 bacterial species of which up to 80{\%} could be identified by PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Analysis of the human vaginal microbiome using the bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region on MiSeq generated 129 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from which 70 species could be identified. For the PacBio, 36,000 sequences from over 58,000 raw reads could be assigned to a barcode, and the in silico selected bacterial 16S rRNA V1V2 gene region generated 154 OTUs grouped into 63 species, of which 62{\%} were shared with the MiSeq dataset. The PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene datasets generated 261 OTUs, which were grouped into 52 species, of which 54{\%} were shared with the MiSeq dataset. Alpha diversity index reported a higher diversity in the MiSeq dataset. CONCLUSION The PacBio sequencing error rate is now in the same range of the previously widely used Roche 454 sequencing platform and current MiSeq platform. Species-level microbiome analysis revealed some inconsistencies between the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene capillary sequencing and PacBio sequencing.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) manifests in the lungs resulting in chronic microbial infection. Most mor-bidity and mortality in CF is due to cycles of pulmonary exacerbations—episodes of acute inflammation in response to the lung microbiome—which are difficult to prevent and treat because their cause is not well understood. We hypothesized that longitudinal analyses of the bacterial component of the CF lung microbiome may elucidate causative agents within this community for pulmonary exacerbations. In this study, 6 participants were sampled thrice-weekly for up to one year. During sampling, sputum, and data (antibiotic usage, spi-rometry, and symptom scores) were collected. Time points were categorized based on rela-tion to exacerbation as Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment. Retrospectively, a subset of were interrogated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When samples were examined categori-cally, a significant difference between the lung microbiota in Stable, Intermediate, and Treat-ment samples was observed in a subset of participants. However, when samples were examined longitudinally, no correlations between microbial composition and collected data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were observed upon exacerbation onset. In this study, we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur out-side of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.},

abstract = {The characterization of bacterial communities using DNA sequencing has revolutionized our ability to study microbes in nature and discover the ways in which microbial communities affect ecosystem functioning and human health. Here we describe Serial Illumina Sequencing (SI-Seq): a method for deep sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using next-generation sequencing technology. SI-Seq serially sequences portions of the V5, V6 and V7 hypervariable regions from barcoded 16S rRNA amplicons using an Illumina short-read genome analyzer. SI-Seq obtains taxonomic resolution similar to 454 pyrosequencing for a fraction of the cost, and can produce hundreds of thousands of reads per sample even with very high multiplexing. We validated SI-Seq using single species and mock community controls, and via a comparison to cystic fibrosis lung microbiota sequenced using 454 FLX Titanium. Our control runs show that SI-Seq has a dynamic range of at least five orders of magnitude, can classify {\textgreater}96{\%} of sequences to the genus level, and performs just as well as 454 and paired-end Illumina methods in estimation of standard microbial ecology diversity measurements. We illustrate the utility of SI-Seq in a pilot sample of central airway secretion samples from cystic fibrosis patients.},

@article{Perez-Munoz2017,
abstract = {After more than a century of active research, the notion that the human fetal environment is sterile and that the neonate's microbiome is acquired during and after birth was an accepted dogma. However, recent studies using molecular techniques suggest bacterial communities in the placenta, amniotic fluid, and meconium from healthy pregnancies. These findings have led many scientists to challenge the “sterile womb paradigm” and propose that microbiome acquisition instead begins in utero, an idea that would fundamentally change our understanding of gut microbiota acquisition and its role in human development. In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the evidence supporting these two opposing hypotheses, specifically as it relates to (i) anatomical, immunological, and physiological characteristics of the placenta and fetus; (ii) the research methods currently used to study microbial populations in the intrauterine environment; (iii) the fecal microbiome during the first days of life; and (iv) the generation of axenic animals and humans. Based on this analysis, we argue that the evidence in support of the “in utero colonization hypothesis” is extremely weak as it is founded almost entirely on studies that (i) used molecular approaches with an insufficient detection limit to study “low-biomass” microbial populations, (ii) lacked appropriate controls for contamination, and (iii) failed to provide evidence of bacterial viability. Most importantly, the ability to reliably derive axenic animals via cesarean sections strongly supports sterility of the fetal environment in mammals. We conclude that current scientific evidence does not support the existence of microbiomes within the healthy fetal milieu, which has implications for the development of clinical practices that prevent microbiome perturbations after birth and the establishment of future research priorities.},

abstract = {The human microbiome has emerged as a major player in regulating human health and disease. Translational studies of the microbiome have the potential to indicate clinical applications such as fecal transplants and probiotics. However, one major issue is accurate identification of microbes constituting the microbiota. Studies of the microbiome have frequently utilized sequencing of the conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. We present a comparative study of an alternative approach using whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). In the present study, we analyzed the human fecal microbiome compiling a total of 194.1 × 10(6) reads from a single sample using multiple sequencing methods and platforms. Specifically, after establishing the reproducibility of our methods with extensive multiplexing, we compared: 1) The 16S rRNA amplicon versus the WGS method, 2) the Illumina HiSeq versus MiSeq platforms, 3) the analysis of reads versus de novo assembled contigs, and 4) the effect of shorter versus longer reads. Our study demonstrates that whole genome shotgun sequencing has multiple advantages compared with the 16S amplicon method including enhanced detection of bacterial species, increased detection of diversity and increased prediction of genes. In addition, increased length, either due to longer reads or the assembly of contigs, improved the accuracy of species detection.},

abstract = {The major therapeutic strategy used to treat exacerbated cystic fibrosis (CF) is antibiotic treatment. As this approach easily generates antibiotic-resistant strains of opportunistic bacteria, optimized antibiotic therapies are required to effectively control chronic and recurrent bacterial infections in CF patients. A promising future for the proper use of antibiotics is the management of lung microbiota. However, the impact of antibiotic treatments on CF microbiota and vice versa is not fully understood. This study analyzed 718 sputum samples from 18 previous studies to identify differences between CF and uninfected lung microbiota and to evaluate the effects of antibiotic treatments on exacerbated CF microbiota. A reference-based OTU (operational taxonomic unit) picking method was used to combine analyses of data generated using different protocols and platforms. Findings show that CF microbiota had greater richness and lower diversity in the community structure than uninfected control (NIC) microbiota. Specifically, CF microbiota showed higher levels of opportunistic bacteria and dramatically lower levels of commensal bacteria. Antibiotic treatment affected exacerbated CF microbiota notably but only transiently during the treatment period. Limited decrease of the dominant opportunistic bacteria and a dramatic decrease of commensal bacteria were observed during the antibiotic treatment for CF exacerbation. Simultaneously, low abundance opportunistic bacteria were thriving after the antibiotic treatment. The inefficiency of the current antibiotic treatment against major opportunistic bacteria and the detrimental effects on commensal bacteria indicate that the current empiric antibiotic treatment on CF exacerbation should be reevaluated and optimized.},

Here, we provide a proof of principle for disease monitoring using personal metagenomic sequencing and traditional clinical microbiology by focusing on three adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). The CF lung is a dynamic environment that hosts a complex ecosystem composed of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that can vary in space and time. Not surprisingly, the microbiome data from the induced sputum samples we collected revealed a significant amount of species diversity not seen in routine clinical laboratory cultures. The relative abundances of several species changed as clinical treatment was altered, enabling the identification of the climax and attack communities that were proposed in an earlier work. All patient microbiomes encoded a diversity of mechanisms to resist antibiotics, consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients. The metabolic potentials of these communities differed by the health status and recovery route of each patient. Thus, this pilot study provides an example of how metagenomic data might be used with clinical assessments for the development of treatments tailored to individual patients.},

abstract = {The lung microbiome, which is believed to be stable or at least transient in healthy people, is now considered as a poly-microorganism component contributing to disease pathogenesis. Most research studies on the respiratory microbiome have focused on bacteria and their impact on lung health, but there is evidence that other non-bacterial organisms, comprising the viruses (virome) and fungi (mycobiome), are also likely to play an important role in healthy people as well as in patients. In the last few years, the lung mycobiome (previously named the fungal microbiota or microbiome) has drawn closer attention. There is growing evidence that the lung mycobiome has a significant impact on clinical outcome of chronic respiratory diseases (CRD) such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Thanks to advances in culture independent methods, especially next generation sequencing, a number of fungi not detected by culture methods have been molecularly identified in human lungs. It has been shown that the structure and diversity of the lung mycobiome vary in different populations (healthy and different diseased individuals) which could play a role in CRD. Moreover, the link between lung mycobiome and different biomes of other body sites, especially the gut, has also been unraveled. By interacting with the bacteriome and/or virome, the respiratory mycobiome appears to be a cofactor in inflammation and in the host immune response, and therefore may contribute to the decline of the lung function and the disease progression. In this review, we report the recent limited explorations of the human respiratory mycobiome, and discuss the mycobiome's connections with other local microbial communities, as well as the relationships with the different biomes of other body sites. These studies suggest several outlooks for this understudied emerging field, which will certainly call for a renewal of our understanding of pulmonary diseases.},

This method, UniFrac, measures the phylogenetic distance between sets of taxa in a phylogenetic tree as the fraction of the branch length of the tree that leads to descendants from either one environment or the other, but not both. UniFrac can be used to determine whether communities are signifi- cantly different, to compare many communities simultaneously using clustering and ordination techniques, and to measure the relative contributions of different factors, such as chemistry and geography, to similarities between samples. We demonstrate the utility of UniFrac by applying it to published 16S rRNA gene libraries from cultured isolates and environmental clones of bacteria in marine sediment, water, and ice. Our results reveal that (i) cultured isolates from ice, water, and sediment resemble each other and environmental clone sequences from sea ice, but not environmental clone sequences from sediment and water; (ii) the geographical location does not correlate strongly with bacterial community differences in ice and sediment from the Arctic and Antarctic; and (iii) bacterial communities differ between terrestrially impacted seawater (whether polar or temperate) and warm oligotrophic seawater, whereas those in individual seawater samples are not more similar to each other than to those in sediment or ice samples. These results illustrate that UniFrac provides a new way of characterizing microbial communities, using the wealth of environmental rRNA sequences, and allows quantitative insight into the factors that underlie the distribution of lineages among environments.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic bacteria causing a wide variety of nosocomial infections. The expression of virulence genes in the infection site plays an important pathophysiological role. The transcription of several virulence genes of P. aeruginosa is controlled by a regulatory mechanism depending on bacterial density, named quorum-sensing (QS). Two QS systems, las and rhl, were identified in P. aeruginosa. Each system is defined by a couple of a regulation protein and an autoinducer enzyme: LasR/LasI and RhlR/RhlI for the las and rhlr QS systems, respectively. The autoinducer enzyme contributes to the synthesis of small molecules, the acyl homoserin lactones (AHLs) which easily diffuse through bacterial membranes. When they reach a critical level, the AHLs are linked to the regulation protein. The resulting complex activates the transcription of multiple virulence genes. This activation can amplify and synchronise the virulence of the whole bacterial population. The AHLs also have an immuno-modulation activity, which plays a role in the pathophysiology of the infection. The role of the QS was experimentally demonstrated in different animal models of P. aeruginosa infections. In humans, the expression of the QS and the presence of AHL were detected in respiratory specimens of cystic fibrosis patients infected by P. aeruginosa. The effect of QS in other types of infection requires further studies. As a whole, the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of QS offers the opportunity to develop new therapeutic targets to attenuate the virulence of strains during P. aeruginosa infections. {\textcopyright} 2004 Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de r{\'{e}}animation de langue fran{\c{c}}aise.

abstract = {Pulmonary exacerbations account for much of the decrease in lung function and consequently most of the morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis. These events are driven by an acute inflammatory response to infection. Recent technological advancements in molecular profiling techniques have allowed for a proliferation of microbiome studies of the lower airways of patients with cystic fibrosis. But these methods may not provide a comprehensive and unbiased measure of the lung microbiota in these patients and molecular profiles do not always translate to quantitative microbiology. Furthermore, these studies have not yet been able to provide much in the way of mechanistic insights into exacerbations or to guide patient therapy. We propose a model in which pulmonary exacerbations may be driven by an active subpopulation of the lung microbiota, which may represent only a small portion of the microbiota measured in a clinical sample. Methodology should be focused on the ultimate goal, which is to use the best available approaches to provide accurate quantitative measures of the microbiome to inform clinical decisions and provide rapid assessment of treatment efficacy. These strategies would be relevant to other chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neutrophilic asthma.},

The gene set, approximately 150 times larger than the human gene complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably includes a large proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99{\%} of the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire cohort harbours between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared.

The structure and dynamics of CF respiratory tract microbial communities during the early stages of P. aeruginosa colonization were characterized by pyrosequencing and cloning‑sequencing. The respiratory microbiota showed high diversity, related to the young age of the CF cohort (mean age 10 years). Wide inter‑ and intra‑individual variations were revealed. A common core microbiota of 5 phyla and 13 predominant genera was found, the majority of which were obligate anaerobes. A few genera were significantly more prevalent in patients never infected by P. aeruginosa. Persistence of an anaerobic core microbiota regardless of P. aeruginosa status suggests a major role of certain anaerobes in the pathophysiology of lung infections in CF. Some genera may be potential biomarkers of pulmonary infection state.},

abstract = {Bacterial diversity among environmental samples is commonly assessed with PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene (16S) se-quences. Perceived diversity, however, can be influenced by sample preparation, primer selection, and formation of chimeric 16S amplification products. Chimeras are hybrid products between multiple parent sequences that can be falsely interpreted as novel organisms, thus inflating apparent diversity. We developed a new chimera detection tool called Chimera Slayer (CS). CS detects chimeras with greater sensitivity than previous methods, performs well on short se-quences such as those produced by the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Genome Sequencer, and can scale to large data sets. By benchmarking CS performance against sequences derived from a controlled DNA mixture of known organisms and a simulated chimera set, we provide insights into the factors that affect chimera formation such as sequence abundance, the extent of similarity between 16S genes, and PCR conditions. Chimeras were found to reproducibly form among independent amplifications and contributed to false perceptions of sample diversity and the false identification of novel taxa, with less-abundant species exhibiting chimera rates exceeding 70{\%}. Shotgun metagenomic sequences of our mock community appear to be devoid of 16S chimeras, supporting a role for shotgun metagenomics in validating novel or-ganisms discovered in targeted sequence surveys. [Supplemental material is available for this article. The sequence data from this study have been submitted to the NCBI Entrez Genome Project database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj) under ID nos. 48465, 48471, 53501, and 60767. Software tools and data sets are freely available at http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net.] The analysis of 16S rRNA (16S) genes has become an essential component of the microbial ecologist's tool kit to evaluate the microbial composition of diverse habitats such as soils, oceans, and our own bodies. The high-sequence conservation of 16S genes among diverse bacteria allows for the phylogenetic analysis of or-ganism diversity and the identification of new taxa. The majority of bacterial phyla are known only from 16S surveys and have no cultured representatives (Rappe and Giovannoni 2003; Wu et al. 2009). Several online resources host large, curated collections of 16S sequences, including GreenGenes (DeSantis et al. 2006a), the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (Cole et al. 2009), SILVA (Pruesse et al. 2007), and EZ-Taxon (Chun et al. 2007). Despite efforts by the curators to remove low-quality sequences from survey data, it is likely that many of these reference sequences reflect sequencing artifacts rather than real biological diversity.},

Most morbidity and mortality in CF is due to cycles of pulmonary exacerbations-episodes of acute inflammation in response to the lung microbiome-which are difficult to prevent and treat because their cause is not well understood. We hypothesized that longitudinal analyses of the bacterial component of the CF lung microbiome may elucidate causative agents within this community for pulmonary exacerbations. In this study, 6 participants were sampled thrice-weekly for up to one year. During sampling, sputum, and data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were collected. Time points were categorized based on relation to exacerbation as Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment. Retrospectively, a subset of were interrogated via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. When samples were examined categorically, a significant difference between the lung microbiota in Stable, Intermediate, and Treatment samples was observed in a subset of participants. However, when samples were examined longitudinally, no correlations between microbial composition and collected data (antibiotic usage, spirometry, and symptom scores) were observed upon exacerbation onset. In this study, we identified no universal indicator within the lung microbiome of exacerbation onset but instead showed that changes to the CF lung microbiome occur outside of acute pulmonary episodes and are patient-specific.},

abstract = {Culture-independent microbiological techniques have shown a previously unappreciated complexity to the bacterial microbiome of the respiratory tract that forces reconsideration of the interactions between host, bacteria, and the pathogenesis of exacerbations of chronic lung disease. The composition of the lung microbiome is determined by microbial immigration, elimination, and relative growth rates of its members. All these factors change dramatically in chronic lung disease and further during exacerbations. Exacerbations lack the features of bacterial infections, including increased bacterial burden and decreased diversity of microbial communities. We propose that exacerbations are occasions of respiratory tract dysbiosis--a disorder of the respiratory tract microbial ecosystem with negative effects on host biology. Respiratory tract dysbiosis provokes a dysregulated host immune response, which in turn alters growth conditions for microbes in airways, promoting further dysbiosis and perpetuating a cycle of inflammation and disordered microbiota. Differences in the composition of baseline respiratory tract microbiota might help to explain the so-called frequent-exacerbator phenotype observed in several disease states, and might provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention.},

Based on this evaluation a selection of 'best available' primer pairs for Bacteria and Archaea for three amplicon size classes (100-400, 400-1000, ≥ 1000 bp) is provided. The most promising bacterial primer pair (S-D-Bact-0341-b-S-17/S-D-Bact-0785-a-A-21), with an amplicon size of 464 bp, was experimentally evaluated by comparing the taxonomic distribution of the 16S rDNA amplicons with 16S rDNA fragments from directly sequenced metagenomes. The results of this study may be used as a guideline for selecting primer pairs with the best overall coverage and phylum spectrum for specific applications, therefore reducing the bias in PCR-based microbial diversity studies.},

Moreover, certain strains of LAB produce the complex vitamin cobalamin (or vitamin B12).

Notre population a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} divis{\'{e}}e en un groupe de 34 patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA pr{\'{e}}coce avant l'{\^{a}}ge de 2ans et un groupe de 95 patients n'ayant pas eu de primo-d{\'{e}}tection {\`{a}} PA. 

R{\'{E}}SULTATS
Le groupe de patients ayant eu une primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA avait significativement un diagnostic de mucoviscidose plus pr{\'{e}}coce (1,5mois vs. 23,4mois ; p=0,0017). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus souvent diagnostiqu{\'{e}}s suite au d{\'{e}}pistage n{\'{e}}onatal (14,7 {\%} vs. 6,4 {\%} ; p=0,0453). Le chlore sudoral {\'{e}}tait plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} au diagnostic (104,1mmol/l vs 88mmol/l ; p=0,0222). Ils {\'{e}}taient plus fr{\'{e}}quemment homozygote pour la mutation F508del (61,8 {\%} vs. 40,9 {\%} ; p=0,0452). Ils avaient {\'{e}}galement un nombre plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}} de bact{\'{e}}ries dans leurs s{\'{e}}cr{\'{e}}tions respiratoires (1,8 vs. 1,3 ; p=0,0317), de Staphylocoque aureus meticilline sensible (60 {\%} vs. 33,7 {\%} ; p=0,0177) et d'Haemophilus influenzae (80 {\%} vs. 51,6 {\%} ; p=0,0061). Il ne ressort pas de facteurs environnementaux int{\'{e}}rieurs et/ou ext{\'{e}}rieurs corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}s avec l'acquisition pr{\'{e}}coce de PA. 

CONCLUSION
Nous n'avons pu retrouv{\'{e}} de facteur de risque environnemental de primo-d{\'{e}}tection pr{\'{e}}coce {\`{a}} PA. Malgr{\'{e}} cela, la source de PA primitive se trouverait bien dans l'environnement quotidien des patients atteints de mucoviscidose {\'{e}}tant donn{\'{e}} son habitat aquatique. La contamination est certainement plurifactorielle quel que soit l'{\^{a}}ge. Les limites de cette {\'{e}}tude n{\'{e}}cessitent d'{\^{e}}tre prudent quant aux r{\'{e}}sultats. Les r{\`{e}}gles d'hygi{\`{e}}ne pr{\'{e}}conis{\'{e}}s dans le cadre de la prise en charge globale de la mucoviscidose ne doivent pas devenir une obsession ou emp{\^{e}}cher les parents de patients de vivre une vie sociale la plus normale possible.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
La colonisation des voies a{\'{e}}riennes par Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) est fr{\'{e}}quente chez les patients atteints de mucoviscidose. Elle contribue {\`{a}} aggraver les signes respiratoires. Toutefois, pour des raisons qui restent encore {\`{a}} explorer, certains patients restent indemnes de cette colonisation jusqu'{\`{a}} l'{\^{a}}ge adulte (sujets class{\'{e}}s « never »). L'objectif de notre {\'{e}}tude, baptis{\'{e}}e PYOnever, {\'{e}}tait de pr{\'{e}}ciser les caract{\'{e}}ristiques cliniques, g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tiques et microbiologiques de ces adultes dits « never ». 

M{\'{E}}THODES
Les param{\`{e}}tres cliniques, g{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}tiques et microbiologiques de 2130 patients {\^{a}}g{\'{e}}s de plus de 20ans ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} analys{\'{e}}s r{\'{e}}trospectivement {\`{a}} partir des donn{\'{e}}es enregistr{\'{e}}es dans le registre fran{\c{c}}ais de la mucoviscidose entre janvier 2013 et d{\'{e}}cembre 2014. Les groupes « never » et « pyo » (sujets ayant des expectorations positives {\`{a}} P. aeruginosa) ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} compar{\'{e}}s par r{\'{e}}gression logistique. Les param{\`{e}}tres avec un p{\textless}0,05 en analyse bi-vari{\'{e}}e ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} inclus dans le mod{\`{e}}le multivari{\'{e}} (mod{\`{e}}le de r{\'{e}}gression logistique avec s{\'{e}}lection de variables par la m{\'{e}}thode backward).

Apr{\`{e}}s analyse multivari{\'{e}}e et prise en compte de l'{\^{a}}ge, du sexe, de l'insuffisance pancr{\'{e}}atique, du diab{\`{e}}te et de l'aspergillose broncho-pulmonaire allergique ; l'absence de la mutation F508del {\`{a}} l'{\'{e}}tat homozygote sur le g{\`{e}}ne CFTR et l'{\^{a}}ge au diagnostic de la maladie {\'{e}}taient apparus significativement associ{\'{e}}s {\`{a}} une absence de colonisation par P. aeruginosa {\`{a}} l'{\^{a}}ge adulte (OR=3,75, IC 95 {\%} : [1,4–10,05] ; OR=1,03, IC 95 {\%} : [1,01–1,05] respectivement). Sur le plan microbiologique, la pr{\'{e}}sence de S. aureus et H. influenzae dans les pr{\'{e}}l{\`{e}}vements respiratoires {\'{e}}tait significativement plus {\'{e}}lev{\'{e}}e dans le groupe « never », apr{\`{e}}s ajustement sur l'{\^{a}}ge au diagnostic et le VEMS.

abstract = {Understanding the significance of bacterial species that colonize and persist in cystic fibrosis (CF) airways requires a detailed examination of bacterial community structure across a broad range of age and disease stage. We used 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing to characterize the lung microbiota in 269 CF patients spanning a 60 year age range, including 76 pediatric samples from patients of age 4-17, and a broad cross-section of disease status to identify features of bacterial community structure and their relationship to disease stage and age. The CF lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. The core microbiota consists of five genera - Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces. CF-associated pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to dominate the bacterial community when present. Community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. Lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. Infection by Pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients suffer from chronic bacterial lung infections that lead to death in the majority of cases. The need to maintain lung function in these patients means that characterising these infections is vital. Increasingly, culture-independent analyses are expanding the number of bacterial species associated with CF respiratory samples; however, the potential significance of these species is not known. Here, we applied ecological statistical tools to such culture-independent data, in a novel manner, to partition taxa within the metacommunity into core and satellite species. Sputa and clinical data were obtained from 14 clinically stable adult CF patients. Fourteen rRNA gene libraries were constructed with 35 genera and 82 taxa, identified in 2139 bacterial clones. Shannon-Wiener and taxa-richness analyses confirmed no undersampling of bacterial diversity. By decomposing the distribution using the ratio of variance to the mean taxon abundance, we partitioned objectively the species abundance distribution into core and satellite species. The satellite group comprised 67 bacterial taxa from 33 genera and the core group, 15 taxa from 7 genera (including Pseudomonas (1 taxon), Streptococcus (2), Neisseria (2), Catonella (1), Porphyromonas (1), Prevotella (5) and Veillonella (3)], the last four being anaerobes). The core group was dominated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other recognised CF pathogens were rare. Mantel and partial Mantel tests assessed which clinical factors influenced the composition observed. CF transmembrane conductance regulator genotype and antibiotic treatment correlated with all core taxa. Lung function correlated with richness. The clinical significance of these core and satellite species findings in the CF lung is discussed. GenBank accession numbers: FM995625–FM997761},

Although aerosolization of Tobramycin into the airway of CF patients improves outcomes, the lungs of CF patients, even those receiving antibiotic therapy, are persistently colonized by P. aeruginosa. Recent studies suggest that the antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa in the CF lung is due to the formation of drug resistant biofilms, which are defined as communities of microbes associated with surfaces or interfaces, and whose growth is facilitated by thick and dehydrated mucus in the CF lung. In this review, we discuss some of the current models used to study biofilm formation in the context of biotic surfaces, such as airway cells, as well as the contribution of host-derived factors, including DNA, actin and mucus, to the formation of these microbial communities. We suggest that better in vitro models are required, both to understand the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the host airway, and as models to validate new therapeutics, whether targeted at bacteria or host.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Analysis of cell-free foetal DNA (cff-DNA) in maternal plasma is very promising for early diagnosis of monogenic diseases; in particular, cystic fibrosis (CF). However, NIPD of single-gene disorders has been limited by the availability of suitable technical platforms and the need to set up patient or disease-specific custom-made approaches. METHODS To make research applications more readily accessible to the clinic, we offer a simple assay combining two independent methods to determine the presence or absence of paternally inherited foetal allele p.Phe508del (the most frequent mutation in CF patients worldwide). The first method detects the presence or absence of a p.Phe508del allele by Mutant Enrichment with 3'-Modified Oligonucleotide PCR coupled to Fragment Length Analysis (MEMO-PCR-FLA). The second method detects the p.Phe508del allele with classical Multiplex Fluorescent PCR including five intragenic and extragenic STR markers of the CFTR locus and a specific SRY sequence. RESULTS We collected 24 plasma samples from 23 women carrying foetuses at risk for CF and tested each sample using both methods. Our new procedures were successfully applied to 10 couples where fathers carried the p.Phe508del mutation and mothers were carrying a different mutation in the CFTR gene. These simple tests provided clear positive or negative results from the maternal plasma of the pregnant women. We confirmed the presence of cff-DNA in the studied samples by the identification of a tri-allelic DNA profile using a miniSTR kit. All results were correlated with chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis analyses. CONCLUSIONS This NIPD approach, easily set up in any clinical laboratory where prenatal diagnosis is routinely performed, offers many advantages over current methods: it is simple, rapid, and cost-effective. It opens up the possibility for testing a large number of couples with offspring at risk for CF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences are widely used in environmental microbiology and molecular evolution as reliable markers for the taxonomic classification and phylogenetic analysis of microbes. Restricted by current sequencing techniques, the massive sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons encompassing the full length of genes is not yet feasible. Thus, the selection of the most efficient hypervariable regions for phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic classification is still debated. In the present study, several bioinformatics tools were integrated to build an in silico pipeline to evaluate the phylogenetic sensitivity of the hypervariable regions compared with the corresponding full-length sequences. RESULTS The correlation of seven sub-regions was inferred from the geodesic distance, a parameter that is applied to quantitatively compare the topology of different phylogenetic trees constructed using the sequences from different sub-regions. The relationship between different sub-regions based on the geodesic distance indicated that V4-V6 were the most reliable regions for representing the full-length 16S rRNA sequences in the phylogenetic analysis of most bacterial phyla, while V2 and V8 were the least reliable regions. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that V4-V6 might be optimal sub-regions for the design of universal primers with superior phylogenetic resolution for bacterial phyla. A potential relationship between function and the evolution of 16S rRNA is also discussed.},

abstract = {The structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in the airways of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF) remain largely unknown. We characterized the bacterial communities in 126 sputum samples representing serial collections spanning 8-9 y from six age-matched male CF patients. Sputum DNA was analyzed by bar-coded pyrosequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene, defining 662 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from {\textgreater}633,000 sequences. Bacterial community diversity decreased significantly over time in patients with typically progressive lung disease but remained relatively stable in patients with a mild lung disease phenotype. Antibiotic use, rather than patient age or lung function, was the primary driver of decreasing diversity. Interpatient variability in community structure exceeded intrapatient variability in serial samples. Antibiotic treatment was associated with pronounced shifts in community structure, but communities showed both short- and long-term resilience after antibiotic perturbation. There was a positive correlation between OTU occurrence and relative abundance, with a small number of persistent OTUs accounting for the greatest abundance. Significant changes in community structure, diversity, or total bacterial density at the time of pulmonary exacerbation were not observed. Despite decreasing community diversity in patients with progressive disease, total bacterial density remained relatively stable over time.

abstract = {Recent work using culture-independent methods suggests that the lungs of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients harbor a vast array of bacteria not conventionally implicated in CF lung disease. However, sampling lung secretions in living subjects requires that expectorated specimens or collection devices pass through the oropharynx. Thus, contamination could confound results. Here, we compared culture-independent analyses of throat and sputum specimens to samples directly obtained from the lungs at the time of transplantation. We found that CF lungs with advanced disease contained relatively homogenous populations of typical CF pathogens. In contrast, upper-airway specimens from the same subjects contained higher levels of microbial diversity and organisms not typically considered CF pathogens. Furthermore, sputum exhibited day-to-day variation in the abundance of nontypical organisms, even in the absence of clinical changes. These findings suggest that oropharyngeal contamination could limit the accuracy of DNA-based measurements on upper-airway specimens. This work highlights the importance of sampling procedures for microbiome studies and suggests that methods that account for contamination are needed when DNA-based methods are used on clinical specimens.},

abstract = {In a process termed quorum sensing, bacteria use diffusible chemical signals to coordinate cell density-dependent gene expression. In the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, quorum sensing controls hundreds of genes, many of which encode extracellular virulence factors. Quorum sensing is required for P. aeruginosa virulence in animal models. Curiously, quorum sensing-deficient variants, most of which carry a mutation in the gene encoding the central quorum sensing regulator lasR, are frequently isolated from acute and chronic infections. The mechanism for their emergence is not known. Here we provide experimental evidence suggesting that these lasR mutants are social cheaters that cease production of quorum-controlled factors and take advantage of their production by the group. We detected an emerging subpopulation of lasR mutants after approximately 100 generations of in vitro evolution of the P. aeruginosa wild-type strain under culture conditions that require quorum sensing for growth. Under such conditions, quorum sensing appears to impose a metabolic burden on the proliferating bacterial cell, because quorum-controlled genes not normally induced until cessation of growth were highly expressed early in growth, and a defined lasR mutant showed a growth advantage when cocultured with the parent strain. The emergence of quorum-sensing-deficient variants in certain environments is therefore an indicator of high quorum sensing activity of the bacterial population as a whole. It does not necessarily indicate that quorum sensing is insignificant, as has previously been suggested. Thus, novel antivirulence strategies aimed at disrupting bacterial communication may be particularly effective in such clinical settings.},

Notably, these microorganisms exceed the number of cells in the human body by 10-fold. This finding has accelerated a shift in our understanding of human physiology, with the realization that traits necessary for health are both encoded and influenced by the human genome and the microbiota. Our understanding of the aetiology of complex diseases has, therefore, evolved with increasing awareness that the human microbiota has an active and critical role in maintaining health and inducing disease. Indeed, findings from bioinformatic studies indicate that the microbiota and microbiome have multiple effects on the innate and adaptive immune systems, with effects on infection, autoimmune disease and cancer. In this Review, we first address the important statistical and informatics aspects that should be considered when characterizing the composition of microbiota. We next highlight the effects of the microbiota on the immune system and the implications of these effects on organ failure and transplantation. Finally, we reflect on the future perspectives for studies of the microbiota, including novel diagnostic tests and therapeutics.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal lethal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population. The major cause of mortality is lung disease, owing to the failure of a functional protein from the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Today, even though the knowledge about the CFTR genomic is extensive, no efficient treatment has been developed yet. In this context, gene therapy represents a potential important advance on condition that it could develop efficient and safe transfection agents. Even though viral vectors have been used in most clinical trials owing to their high transfection efficiency, random integration and immunogenicity are still critical side effects. Consequently, all of these drawbacks brought forth the development of nonviral transfection systems. Although they engender few toxicity and immunogenicity problems, their low transfection efficiency is a hurdle that must be overcome. Over the past decade, we have developed an original family of monocationic lipids, cationic phosphonolipids, whose efficiency has been previously demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we observe that a new cationic phosphonolipid (KLN 30) can lead to the restoration of the CFTR protein following the ex vivo transfection of epithelial cells issuing from a F508 homozygous patient. The transgene expression and the cytotoxicity correlate with the charge ratio of the lipoplex. A kinetic study was performed, and a luminescent signal was detected until 35 d after transfection.},

We recently reported that l-alanine is a preferred carbon source for P. aeruginosa and that two genes potentially involved in alanine catabolism (dadA and dadX) are induced during in vivo growth in the rat peritoneum and during in vitro growth in sputum (mucus) collected from the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis. The goals of this study were to characterize factors required for alanine catabolism in P. aeruginosa and to assess the importance of these factors for in vivo growth. Our results reveal that dadA and dadX are arranged in an operon and are required for catabolism of l-alanine. The dad operon is inducible by l-alanine, d-alanine, and l-valine, and induction is dependent on the transcriptional regulator Lrp. Finally, we show that a mutant unable to catabolize dl-alanine displays decreased competitiveness in a rat lung model of infection.},

The CF lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. The core microbiota consists of five genera - Streptococcus, Prevotella, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces. CF-associated pathogens such as Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, Stenotrophomonas and Achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to dominate the bacterial community when present. Community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. Lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. Infection by Pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.},

abstract = {The airways of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically colonized by patient-specific polymicrobial communities. The conditions and nutrients available in CF lungs affect the physiology and composition of the colonizing microbes. Recent work in bioreactors has shown that the fermentation product 2,3-butanediol mediates cross-feeding between some fermenting bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and that this mechanism increases bacterial current production. To examine bacterial fermentation in the respiratory tract, breath gas metabolites were measured and several metagenomes were sequenced from CF and non-CF volunteers. 2,3-butanedione was produced in nearly all respiratory tracts. Elevated levels in one patient decreased during antibiotic treatment, and breath concentrations varied between CF patients at the same time point. Some patients had high enough levels of 2,3-butanedione to irreversibly damage lung tissue. Antibiotic therapy likely dictates the activities of 2,3-butanedione-producing microbes, which suggests a need for further study with larger sample size. Sputum microbiomes were dominated by P. aeruginosa, Streptococcus spp. and Rothia mucilaginosa, and revealed the potential for 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis. Genes encoding 2,3-butanedione biosynthesis were disproportionately abundant in Streptococcus spp, whereas genes for consumption of butanedione pathway products were encoded by P. aeruginosa and R. mucilaginosa. We propose a model where low oxygen conditions in CF lung lead to fermentation and a decrease in pH, triggering 2,3-butanedione fermentation to avoid lethal acidification. We hypothesize that this may also increase phenazine production by P. aeruginosa, increasing reactive oxygen species and providing additional electron acceptors to CF microbes.},

abstract = {Clustering is an unsupervised process to determine which unlabeled objects in a set share interesting properties. The objects are grouped into k subsets (clusters) whose elements optimize a proximity measure. Methods based on information theory have proven to be feasible alternatives. They are based on the assumption that a cluster is one subset with the minimal possible degree of ``disorder''. They attempt to minimize the entropy of each cluster. We propose a clustering method based on the maximum entropy principle. Such a method explores the space of all possible probability distributions of the data to find one that maximizes the entropy subject to extra conditions based on prior information about the clusters. The prior information is based on the assumption that the elements of a cluster are ``similar'' to each other in accordance with some statistical measure. As a consequence of such a principle, those distributions of high entropy that satisfy the conditions are favored over others. Searching the space to find the optimal distribution of object in the clusters represents a hard combinatorial problem, which disallows the use of traditional optimization techniques. Genetic algorithms are a good alternative to solve this problem. We benchmark our method relative to the best theoretical performance, which is given by the Bayes classifier when data are normally distributed, and a multilayer perceptron network, which offers the best practical performance when data are not normal. In general, a supervised classification method will outperform a non-supervised one, since, in the first case, the elements of the classes are known a priori. In what follows, we show that our method's effectiveness is comparable to a supervised one. This clearly exhibits the superiority of our method.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a pleiotropic disease, originating from mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Lung injuries inflicted by recurring infection and excessive inflammation cause approximately 90{\%} of the morbidity and mortality of CF patients. It remains unclear how CFTR mutations lead to lung illness. Although commonly known as a Cl(-) channel, CFTR also conducts thiocyanate (SCN(-)) ions, important because, in several ways, they can limit potentially harmful accumulations of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and hypochlorite (OCl(-)). First, lactoperoxidase (LPO) in the airways catalyzes oxidation of SCN(-) to tissue-innocuous hypothiocyanite (OSCN(-)), while consuming H(2)O(2). Second, SCN(-) even at low concentrations competes effectively with Cl(-) for myeloperoxidase (MPO) (which is released by white blood cells), thus limiting OCl(-) production by the enzyme. Third, SCN(-) can rapidly reduce OCl(-) without catalysis. Here, we show that SCN(-) and LPO protect a lung cell line from injuries caused by H(2)O(2); and that SCN(-) protects from OCl(-) made by MPO. Of relevance to inflammation in other diseases, we find that in three other tested cell types (arterial endothelial cells, a neuronal cell line, and a pancreatic beta cell line) SCN(-) at concentrations of {\textgreater} or =100 microM greatly attenuates the cytotoxicity of MPO. Humans naturally derive SCN(-) from edible plants, and plasma SCN(-) levels of the general population vary from 10 to 140 microM. Our findings raise the possibility that insufficient levels of antioxidant SCN(-) provide inadequate protection from OCl(-), thus worsening inflammatory diseases, and predisposing humans to diseases linked to MPO activity, including atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, and certain cancers.},

abstract = {Microbial communities have co‑evolved with humans and our ancestors for millions of years and they inhabit all surfaces of the human body, including the respiratory tract mucosa. Specific sites in the respiratory tract contain specialized bacterial communities that are thought to have a major role in the maintenance of human health. In the past decade, next‑generation sequencing has led to major advances in our understanding of the possible functions of the resident microbiota. So far, research has largely focused on the gut microbiota and gut microbiota‑derived metab‑ olites, and their influence on host metabolism and immu‑ nity. However, recent studies on microbial ecosystems at other body sites, including the respiratory tract, reveal an even broader role for the microbiota in human health 1 . The respiratory tract is a complex organ system that is divided into the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The URT includes the anterior nares, nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the naso‑ pharynx and oropharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal cords, whereas the LRT includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal cords, the trachea, smaller airways (that is, bronchi and bronchioli) and alveoli. The primary function of the respiratory tract in human physiology is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. For this purpose, the adult human airways have a surface area of approximately 70 m 2},

abstract = {RATIONALE Pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) is polymicrobial and it is possible that anaerobic bacteria, not detected by routine aerobic culture methods, reside within infected anaerobic airway mucus. OBJECTIVES To determine whether anaerobic bacteria are present in the sputum of patients with CF. METHODS Sputum samples were collected from clinically stable adults with CF and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from children with CF. Induced sputum samples were collected from healthy volunteers who did not have CF. All samples were processed using anaerobic bacteriologic techniques and bacteria within the samples were quantified and identified. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Anaerobic species primarily within the genera Prevotella, Veillonella, Propionibacterium, and Actinomyces were isolated in high numbers from 42 of 66 (64{\%}) sputum samples from adult patients with CF. Colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa significantly increased the likelihood that anaerobic bacteria would be present in the sputum. Similar anaerobic species were identified in BALF from pediatric patients with CF. Although anaerobes were detected in induced sputum samples from 16 of 20 volunteers, they were present in much lower numbers and were generally different species compared with those detected in CF sputum. Species-dependent differences in the susceptibility of the anaerobes to antibiotics with known activity against anaerobes were apparent with all isolates susceptible to meropenem. CONCLUSIONS A range of anaerobic species are present in large numbers in the lungs of patients with CF. If these anaerobic bacteria are contributing significantly to infection and inflammation in the CF lung, informed alterations to antibiotic treatment to target anaerobes, in addition to the primary infecting pathogens, may improve management.},

abstract = {Background: The lung of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is particularly sensitive to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This bacterium plays an important role in the poor outcome of CF patients. During the disease progress, first acquisition of P. aeruginosa is the key-step in the management of CF patients. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) offers an opportunity to detect earlier the first acquisition of P. aeruginosa by CF patients. Given the lack of a validated protocol, our goal was to find an optimal molecular protocol for detection of P. aeruginosa in CF patients. Methods: We compared two formerly described qPCR formats in early detection of P. aeruginosa in CF sputum samples: a qPCR targeting oprL gene, and a multiplex PCR targeting gyrB and ecfX genes. Results: Tested in vitro on a large panel of P. aeruginosa isolates and others gram-negative bacilli, oprL qPCR exhibited a better sensitivity (threshold of 10 CFU/mL versus 730 CFU/mL), whereas the gyrB/ecfX qPCR exhibited a better specificity (90{\%} versus 73{\%}). These results were validated ex vivo on 46 CF sputum samples positive for P. aeruginosa in culture. Ex vivo assays revealed that qPCR detected 100 times more bacterial cells than culture-based method did. Conclusion: Based on these results, we proposed a reference molecular protocol combining the two qPCRs, which offers a sensitivity of 100{\%} with a threshold of 10 CFU/mL and a specificity of 100{\%}. This combined qPCR-based protocol can be adapted and used for other future prospective studies.},

abstract = {Background: Given the polymicrobial nature of pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), it is essential to enhance our knowledge on the composition of the microbial community to improve patient management. In this study, we developed a pyrosequencing approach to extensively explore the diversity and dynamics of fungal and prokaryotic populations in CF lower airways. Methodology and Principal Findings: Fungi and bacteria diversity in eight sputum samples collected from four adult CF patients was investigated using conventional microbiological culturing and high-throughput pyrosequencing approach targeting the ITS2 locus and the 16S rDNA gene. The unveiled microbial community structure was compared to the clinical profile of the CF patients. Pyrosequencing confirmed recently reported bacterial diversity and observed complex fungal communities, in which more than 60{\%} of the species or genera were not detected by cultures. Strikingly, the diversity and species richness of fungal and bacterial communities was significantly lower in patients with decreased lung function and poor clinical status. Values of Chao1 richness estimator were statistically correlated with values of the Shwachman-Kulczycki score, body mass index, forced vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p = 0.046, 0.047, 0.004, and 0.001, respectively for fungal Chao1 indices, and p = 0.010, 0.047, 0.002, and 0.0003, respectively for bacterial Chao1 values). Phylogenetic analysis showed high molecular diversities at the sub-species level for the main fungal and bacterial taxa identified in the present study. Anaerobes were isolated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was more likely to be observed in association with Candida albicans than with Aspergillus fumigatus. Conclusions: In light of the recent concept of CF lung microbiota, we viewed the microbial community as a unique pathogenic entity. We thus interpreted our results to highlight the potential interactions between microorganisms and the role of fungi in the context of improving survival in CF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The miniaturised and portable DNA sequencer MinION™ has been released to the scientific community within the framework of an early access programme to evaluate its application for a wide variety of genetic approaches. This technology has demonstrated great potential, especially in genome-wide analyses. In this study, we tested the ability of the MinION™ system to perform amplicon sequencing in order to design new approaches to study microbial diversity using nearly full-length 16S rDNA sequences. RESULTS Using R7.3 chemistry, we generated more than 3.8 million events (nt) during a single sequencing run. These data were sufficient to reconstruct more than 90 {\%} of the 16S rRNA gene sequences for 20 different species present in a mock reference community. After read mapping and 16S rRNA gene assembly, consensus sequences and 2d reads were recovered to assign taxonomic classification down to the species level. Additionally, we were able to measure the relative abundance of all the species present in a mock community and detected a biased species distribution originating from the PCR reaction using 'universal' primers. CONCLUSIONS Although nanopore-based sequencing produces reads with lower per-base accuracy compared with other platforms, the MinION™ DNA sequencer is valuable for both high taxonomic resolution and microbial diversity analysis. Improvements in nanopore chemistry, such as minimising base-calling errors and the nucleotide bias reported here for 16S amplicon sequencing, will further deliver more reliable information that is useful for the specific detection of microbial species and strains in complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are a family of structurally diverse unconjugated glycans that are highly abundant in and unique to human milk. Originally, HMOs were discovered as a prebiotic "bifidus factor" that serves as a metabolic substrate for desired bacteria and shapes an intestinal microbiota composition with health benefits for the breast-fed neonate. Today, HMOs are known to be more than just "food for bugs". An accumulating body of evidence suggests that HMOs are antiadhesive antimicrobials that serve as soluble decoy receptors, prevent pathogen attachment to infant mucosal surfaces and lower the risk for viral, bacterial and protozoan parasite infections. In addition, HMOs may modulate epithelial and immune cell responses, reduce excessive mucosal leukocyte infiltration and activation, lower the risk for necrotizing enterocolitis and provide the infant with sialic acid as a potentially essential nutrient for brain development and cognition. Most data, however, stem from in vitro, ex vivo or animal studies and occasionally from association studies in mother-infant cohorts. Powered, randomized and controlled intervention studies will be needed to confirm relevance for human neonates. The first part of this review introduces the pioneers in HMO research, outlines HMO structural diversity and describes what is known about HMO biosynthesis in the mother's mammary gland and their metabolism in the breast-fed infant. The second part highlights the postulated beneficial effects of HMO for the breast-fed neonate, compares HMOs with oligosaccharides in the milk of other mammals and in infant formula and summarizes the current roadblocks and future opportunities for HMO research.},

abstract = {Current therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) focuses on minimizing the microbial community and the host's immune response through the aggressive use of airway clearance techniques, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatments that break down the pervasive endobronchial biofilm. Antibiotic selection is typically based on the susceptibility of individual microbial strains to specific antibiotics in vitro. Often this approach cannot accurately predict medical outcomes because of factors both technical and biological. Recent culture-independent assessments of the airway microbial and viral communities demonstrated that the CF airway infection is considerably more complex and dynamic than previously appreciated. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary pressures that shape these communities is critically important for the optimal use of current therapies (in both the choice of therapy and timing of administration) and the development of newer strategies. The climax-attack model (CAM) presented here, grounded in basic ecological principles, postulates the existence of two major functional communities. The attack community consists of transient viral and microbial populations that induce strong innate immune responses. The resultant intense immune response creates microenvironments that facilitate the establishment of a climax community that is slower-growing and inherently resistant to antibiotic therapy. Newer methodologies, including sequence-based metagenomic analysis, can track not only the taxonomic composition but also the metabolic capabilities of these changing viral and microbial communities over time. Collecting this information for CF airways will enable the mathematical modeling of microbial community dynamics during disease progression. The resultant understanding of airway communities and their effects on lung physiology will facilitate the optimization of CF therapies.},

Although the lungs were classically believed to be sterile, recently published investigations have identified microbial communities in the lungs of healthy humans. At the present time, there are significant methodologic and technical hurdles that must be addressed in ongoing investigations, including distinguishing the microbiota of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. However, characterization of the lung microbiome is likely to provide important pathogenic insights into cystic fibrosis, respiratory disease of the newborn, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma. In addition to characterization of the lung microbiome, the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract have profound influence on development and maintenance of lung immunity and inflammation. Further study of gastrointestinal-respiratory interactions are likely to yield important insights into the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases, including asthma. As this field advances over the next several years, we anticipate that studies utilizing larger cohorts, multi-center designs, and longitudinal sampling will add to our knowledge and understanding of the lung microbiome.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Early detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung positivity is a key element in cystic fibrosis (CF) management. PCR has increased the accuracy of detection of many microorganisms. Clinical relevance of P. aeruginosa quantitative PCR (qPCR) in this context is unclear. Our aim was to determine P. aeruginosa qPCR sensitivity and specificity, and to assess the possible time saved by qPCR in comparison with standard practice (culture). METHODS A multicentre cohort study was conducted over a 3-year period in 96 patients with CF without chronic P. aeruginosa colonization. Sputum samples were collected at each visit. Conventional culture and two-step qPCR (oprL qPCR and gyrB/ecfX qPCR) were performed for 707 samples. The positivity criteria were based on the qPCR results, defined in a previous study as follow: oprL qPCR positivity alone if bacterial density was {\textless}730 CFU/mL or oprL qPCR combined with gyrB/ecfX qPCR if bacterial density was ≥730 CFU/mL. RESULTS During follow up, 36 of the 96 patients with CF were diagnosed on culture as colonized with P. aeruginosa. This two-step qPCR displayed a sensitivity of 94.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 79.7{\%}-98.6{\%}), and a specificity of 86.3{\%} (95{\%} CI 83.4{\%}-88.7{\%}). It enabled P. aeruginosa acquisition to be diagnosed earlier in 20 patients, providing a median detection time gain of 8 months (interquartile range 3.7-17.6) for them. CONCLUSIONS Implementing oprL and gyrB/ecfX qPCR in the management of patients with CF allowed earlier detection of first P. aeruginosa lung positivity than culture alone.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of bacterial infections in respiratory diseases. It secretes molecules to dampen host immunity, and the recently identified adenosine is one of these molecules. The type IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2-IIA) is a host protein endowed with antibacterial properties, especially against Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus. However, the role of adenosine in sPLA2-IIA-mediated S. aureus killing by host is still unknown. The present studies showed that the S. aureus mutant lacking adenosine production (∆adsA strain) increased sPLA2-IIA expression in guinea pig airways and was cleared more efficiently, compared with the wild-type strain. S. aureus ∆adsA strain induced sPLA2-IIA expression by alveolar macrophages after phagocytic process via NOD2-NF-$\kappa$B-dependent mechanism. However, S. aureus adenosine (wild-type and adsA-complemented strains) and exogenous adenosine downregulated S. aureus phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages, leading to inhibition of sPLA2-IIA expression. This occurred through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation via adenosine receptors A2a-, A2b-, and protein kinase A-dependent pathways. Taken together, our studies suggest that, in the airway, S. aureus escapes sPLA2-IIA-mediated killing through adenosine-mediated inhibition of phagocytosis and sPLA2-IIA expression.},

ABSTRACT The healthy lung has previously been considered to be a sterile organ because standard microbiological culture techniques consistently yield negative results. However, culture-independent techniques report that large numbers of microorganisms coexist in the lung. There are many unknown aspects in the field, but available reports show that the lower respiratory tract microbiota: 1) is similar in healthy subjects to the oropharyngeal microbiota and dominated by members of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria phyla; 2) shows changes in smokers and well-defined differences in chronic respiratory diseases, although the temporal and spatial kinetics of these changes are only partially known; and 3) shows relatively abundant non-cultivable bacteria in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis, with specific patterns for each disease. In all of these diseases, a loss of diversity, paralleled by an over-representation of Proteobacteria (dysbiosis), has been related to disease severity and exacerbations. However, it is unknown whether dysbiosis is a cause or a consequence of the damage to bronchoalveolar surfaces. Finally, little is known about bacterial functionality and the interactions between viruses, fungi and bacteria. It is expected that future research in bacterial gene expressions, metagenomics longitudinal analysis and host–microbiome animal models will help to move towards targeted microbiome interventions in respiratory diseases.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing technologies generate very large numbers of short reads. Even with very deep genome coverage, short read lengths cause problems in de novo assemblies. The use of paired-end libraries with a fragment size shorter than twice the read length provides an opportunity to generate much longer reads by overlapping and merging read pairs before assembling a genome.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We present FLASH, a fast computational tool to extend the length of short reads by overlapping paired-end reads from fragment libraries that are sufficiently short. We tested the correctness of the tool on one million simulated read pairs, and we then applied it as a pre-processor for genome assemblies of Illumina reads from the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus and human chromosome 14. FLASH correctly extended and merged reads {\textgreater}99{\%} of the time on simulated reads with an error rate of {\textless}1{\%}. With adequately set parameters, FLASH correctly merged reads over 90{\%} of the time even when the reads contained up to 5{\%} errors. When FLASH was used to extend reads prior to assembly, the resulting assemblies had substantially greater N50 lengths for both contigs and scaffolds.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The FLASH system is implemented in C and is freely available as open-source code at http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/flash.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONTACT: t.magoc@gmail.com.},
